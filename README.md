# terraform-project-1
This is my first attempt of making a project with terraform automating AWS infrastructure
I will give a try to:

1. Create a VPC
2. Create an IGW
3. Create a Custom Route Table
4. Create a subnet
5. Associate subnet with Route Table
6. Create Security Group to allow ports 22, 80, 443
7. Create a network interface with an IP in the subnet
8. Assign an elastic IP to the network interface
9. Create an Ubuntu Server and install and enable apache2
